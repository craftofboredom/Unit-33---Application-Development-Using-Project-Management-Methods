This is the second version of our main website.
The agreement was that I will complete the HTML part whilst Dan completes the CSS part.
To start this off, I've created the HTML and agreed to forward this to Dan so he can apply his version of CSS style sheets.
I already had my version of external stylesheets, but I told Dan to amend it he wishes to so he can apply his creativity to the website.
